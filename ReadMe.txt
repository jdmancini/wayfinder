 Wayfinder Image Rotation Script
 Developer : Jeffrey Mancini
 Release Date: 21 April 2015

 Languages: HTML 4.1, CSS, JavaScript, ASP 3.0 and VBScript

 This script was developed to either display a single or
 	rotate a sequence of images on the wayfinder system.  The 
	script was designed to also allow for two emergency status
	levels with appropriate messaging which will override all 
	of the normal displays with a predefined emergency display.
 
 Images can be changed by the end user by adding or removing the
	images from the images folder under the target wayfinder's folder.
	Images must be named following the convention below to be 
	automatically added to the display.  Emergency images must be 
	named emrg_msg_#, evacuation messages must be named evac_msg_# 
	and nrml_msg_#.  Not following this convention *will* inhibit the
	display of images correctly.
