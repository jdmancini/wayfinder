Wayfinder Image Rotation Script<br>Developer : Jeffrey Mancini<br>Release Date: 21 April 2015<br>Languages: HTML 4.1, CSS, JavaScript, ASP 3.0 and VBScript
<p>This script was developed to either display a single or rotate a sequence of images on the wayfinder system.  The script was designed to also allow for two emergency status levels with appropriate messaging which will override all of the normal displays with a predefined emergency display.</p>
<p>Images can be changed by the end user by adding or removing the images from the images folder under the target wayfinder's folder. Images must be named following the convention below to be automatically added to the display.  Emergency images must be named emrg_msg_#, evacuation messages must be named evac_msg_# 	and nrml_msg_#.  Not following this convention *will* inhibit the display of images correctly.</p>
